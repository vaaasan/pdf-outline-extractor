# Adobe Hackathon 2025 - PDF Outline Extractor (Round 1A)

## ðŸš€ Approach

We extract headings from a PDF using font size and layout structure.

### Key Steps:
- Extract text blocks and font size using `PyMuPDF`.
- Sort text by page and position.
- The largest font on the first page is considered the **Title**.
- Next largest fonts across the document are mapped as **H1**, **H2**, and **H3** using thresholds.

## ðŸ§  Libraries Used

- **PyMuPDF (fitz)** â€“ for reading PDFs and extracting text and font size.
- **pdfminer.six** â€“ backup parser in case PyMuPDF fails.
- **NumPy** â€“ for font size clustering and heading level separation.
